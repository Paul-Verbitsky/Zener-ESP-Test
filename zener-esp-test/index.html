            <h2>About the Zener ESP Test</h2>
            <div id="about-test-content">
                <p>The Zener Test is a classic experiment designed to investigate forms of extrasensory perception (ESP), particularly clairvoyance. Participants attempt to identify the symbol or attributes of a hidden card without any sensory input.</p>
                <h3>Test Modes Explained:</h3>
                <h4>Classic (Symbols Only) Mode:</h4>
                <p>In this traditional mode, you are presented with Zener cards featuring one of five unique symbols: Circle, Square, Cross, Star, or Waves. Your task is to guess the hidden symbol of each card. In a standard deck of 25 cards, there are five of each symbol. By pure chance, you would typically expect to guess 5 out of 25 cards correctly.</p>
                <h4>Hard (Symbols & Colors) Mode:</h4>
                <p>This advanced mode introduces an additional layer of complexity. Each Zener card not only has a unique symbol but also a distinct color (Black, Red, Blue, Green, or Yellow). Your challenge is to correctly identify <strong>both</strong> the symbol and the color of the hidden card. With 25 unique symbol-color combinations, the probability of a correct guess by chance is significantly lower. In this mode, you would typically expect to guess only 1 out of 25 cards correctly by pure chance.</p>
                <h3>Understanding Your Results:</h3>
                <p>Your test results are compared against a "chance level" – the score you would statistically achieve by simply guessing randomly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Significantly Above Chance:</strong> If your score is noticeably higher than the expected chance level, it suggests a non-random pattern in your guesses. While intriguing, it's important to remember that such results in a single short test do not definitively prove ESP but indicate an outcome unlikely to be purely coincidental.</li>
                    <li><strong>Close to Chance Level:</strong> A score around the chance level is typical for random guessing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Below Chance Level:</strong> A score significantly below the chance level might suggest a pattern of consistently incorrect guesses, which can sometimes be as statistically interesting as a high score, though still often attributed to random variation in a short series of trials.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What score might be considered "ESP-like" in this test (for entertainment purposes):</h3>
                <p>While this is a simplified test for fun and personal exploration, and real ESP requires rigorous scientific evidence, we can define scores that are highly unlikely to occur by chance within this specific setup:</p>
                <h4>In Classic (Symbols Only) Mode (25 cards):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A score of <strong>8 or more</strong> correct guesses is statistically significant (meaning there's only about a 10.9% chance of getting it randomly).</li>
                    <li>A score of <strong>10 or more</strong> correct guesses is considered highly significant (about 1.18% chance randomly).</li>
                    <li>A score of <strong>15 or more</strong> is extremely rare by chance (roughly 1 in 73,700). Such a result would be highly unusual and warrants further investigation in a scientific context.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>In Hard (Symbols & Colors) Mode (25 cards):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remember, the chance level here is 1 correct guess.</li>
                    <li>A score of <strong>3 or more</strong> correct guesses would be considered very significant, as it's three times the expected random score.</li>
                    <li>A score of <strong>5 or more</strong> would be extremely rare by chance in this more challenging mode.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's crucial to understand that these thresholds are for illustrative purposes within the context of this test. For a more rigorous scientific assessment of ESP, experiments require very strict controls, a much larger number of trials, and complex statistical analysis.</p>
